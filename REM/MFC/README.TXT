========================================================================       MICROSOFT FOUNDATION CLASS LIBRARY : RMND========================================================================AppWizard has created this RMND application for you.  This applicationnot only demonstrates the basics of using the Microsoft Foundation classesbut is also a starting point for writing your application.This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files thatmake up your RMND application.RMND.MAK    This project file is compatible with the Visual C++ development	environment.     It is also compatible with the NMAKE program provided with Visual C++.     To build a debug version of the program from the MS-DOS prompt, typenmake /f RMND.MAK CFG="Win32 Debug"    or to build a release version of the program, typenmake /f RMND.MAK CFG="Win32 Release"RMND.H    This is the main header file for the application.  It includes other    project specific headers (including RESOURCE.H) and declares the    CRmndApp application class.RMND.CPP    This is the main application source file that contains the application    class CRmndApp.RMND.RC    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the    program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored    in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in the    Visual C++ development environment.RES\RMND.ICO    This is an icon file, which is used as the application's icon.  This    icon is included by the main resource file RMND.RC.RES\RMND.RC2    This file contains resources that are not edited by the Visual C++	development environment.  You should place all resources not	editable by the resource editor in this file.RMND.CLW    This file contains information used by ClassWizard to edit existing    classes or add new classes.  ClassWizard also uses this file to store    information needed to create and edit message maps and dialog data    maps and to create prototype member functions./////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////For the main frame window:mainfrm.H, mainfrm.CPP    These files contain the frame class CMainFrame, which is derived from    CMDIFrameWnd and controls all MDI frame features.RES\TOOLBAR.BMP    This bitmap file is used to create tiled images for the toolbar.    The initial toolbar and status bar are constructed in the    CMainFrame class.  Edit this toolbar bitmap along with the    array in mainfrm.CPP to add more toolbar buttons./////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////AppWizard creates one document type and one view:rmnddoc.H, rmnddoc.CPP - the document    These files contain your CRmndDoc class.  Edit these files to    add your special document data and to implement file saving and loading    (via CRmndDoc::Serialize).rmndview.H, rmndview.CPP - the view of the document    These files contain your CRmndView class.    CRmndView objects are used to view CRmndDoc objects.    RES\rmnddoc.ICO    This is an icon file, which is used as the icon for MDI child windows    for the CRmndDoc class.  This icon is included by the main    resource file RMND.RC./////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////Other standard files:STDAFX.H, STDAFX.CPP    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file    named RMND.PCH and a precompiled types file named STDAFX.OBJ.RESOURCE.H    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.    Visual C++ reads and updates this file./////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////Other notes:AppWizard uses "TODO:" to indicate parts of the source code youshould add to or customize./////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
